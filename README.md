# Deposit-Refund Systems for a More Circular Economy


## Abstract & Description 

Plastic is a ubiquitous part of everyday life and affords humans great ease; however, only a small percentage of plastic is recycled worldwide and companies continue to produce plastic, resulting in enormous amounts of carbon emissions being released each year. Since the 1970s, numerous countries and local governments have implemented Deposit-Refund Systems (DRS) on beverage packaging and other items to curb plastic waste. DRSs shift the cost of recycling from taxpayers to producers, by having consumes pay an extra charge when items such as plastic bottles are purchased or used, which is only paid back upon their return. Once returned, beverage companies then collect and pay for items to be recycled. Although individual case studies have explored DRSs, there is no comprehensive source of information on the types of DRS strategies that are used and their effectiveness. This study collected data on existing DRSs worldwide, identified the most effective DRS policies, and created an online bottle deposit database with case studies from over twenty countries to which researchers may consult and contribute. This database provides valuable information concerning the international successes and failures of plastic DRS programs in hopes that it will help avoid ill-informed policies that unnecessarily waste time and capital.

## Frequently Asked Questions 




## Steps to Create Map 

### Create Google sheet and convert to CSV
1. Label columns. If linked url needed, create two columns: citation column (named "citation-#-title") and url column (named "citation-#-url").
1. Each row is a different record. Insert data into rows.
1. Once data entry is completed. Convert to csv and download to your computer. ("File" > "Download" > "Comma-Separated Values") 

### Convert csv to GeoJSON 
1. Upload csv file to [Convert CSV to GeoJSON](http://convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm)
1. Download GeoJSON to computer, upload to GitHub, and name with date. (On GitHub click "data" > "upload files" > save date under "commit changes") 

### Add GeoJSON and csv to GitHub repository

### To add map TBD

## Notes
Key-value pairs have a colon between them as in "key" : "value". Each key-value pair is separated by a comma, so the middle of a JSON looks like this: "key" : "value", "key" : "value", "key": "value". In our example above, the first key-value pair is "first_name" : "Sammy".

JSON keys are on the left side of the colon. They need to be wrapped in double quotation marks, as in "key", and can be any valid string. Within each object, keys need to be unique. These key strings can include whitespaces, as in "first name", but that can make it harder to access when you’re programming, so it’s best to use underscores, as in "first_name".
