 Abstract
Plastic is an essential part of everyday life and affords humans great ease; however, only a small percentage of plastic is recycled worldwide resulting in enormous amounts of waste and carbon emissions produced each year. In recent years, numerous countries and local governments have implemented Deposit-Refund Systems (DRS) on plastic beverage packaging to curb plastic waste. DRSs shifts the cost of recycling from taxpayers to producers, by allowing consumers to drop off used plastic bottles at commercial stores or depots in exchange for money. Beverage companies then collect these bottles for recycling. Although individual case studies have explored DRSs, there are few comprehensive sources of information on the types of DRS strategies that are used and their effectiveness. This study collected data on 28 countries with 47 DRSs, identified the most effective DRS policies, and created an online database (https://ioes.ucla.edu/deposit-refund-systems/) summarizing the basic features of each system for which researchers may consult and contribute in their own studies. Furthermore, through statistical analysis this study found that the most common deposit-refund amount is $0.05 USD, along with early evidence that there may exist a positive correlation between deposit-refund amount and recollection rate.
 
Introduction
Plastic is a ubiquitous part of everyday life, affording humans great ease, yet causing ever-increasing pollution that threatens human and ecosystem health. Specifically, humans produce more than 400 million tons of plastic waste each year and only 9% of it will ever be recycled (United Nations, 2012, p. 4,7). In 2012, the production of plastic resulted in approximately 390 million tons of CO2 released into the atmosphere; and, it is estimated that by 2050, global plastic production will triple in output, going from consuming 6% of the world’s oil to 20% (World Economic Forum, 2016, p. 7, 15). Thus, innovations in our plastic collection systems are crucial for curbing present rates of plastic waste and emissions and achieving a more circular economy.
In recent years, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic has taken over the beverage packaging industry with 26% of the total volume of plastics produced used for beverage packaging alone (World Economic Forum, 2016, p. 7). PET plastic has become the most popular material used for the packaging of beverages such as water, soft drinks, and alcohol due to its lightweight nature and high durability (Welle, 2011). Water beverages packaged in PET containers have especially skyrocketed in production, going from 8.4 billion produced worldwide in 2000 to 42.6 billion in 2010 (Container Recycling Institute, 2013, p. 12).
To increase recycling, many government entities started in the 1970s to implement Deposit-Refund Systems (DRS) on beverage packaging to curb waste. Deposit-Refund Systems are recycling schemes that enact the idea of “Extended Producer Responsibility '' (EPR). EPR is a concept in which the burden of paying to recycle discarded goods is shifted from taxpayers onto producers (Franklin, 1997). Recently, governments have begun integrating PET plastic into their DRSs.
Worldwide, Sweden is the current leader in PET DRS schemes. Its refillable PET return system began in 1991 and has a 98% recycling rate, while its one-way PET bottle recycling system began in 1994 and has a 79% recycling rate (Amano, 2004, p. 10). The Swedish system features consumers who drop off used PET plastic bottles at stores to be redeemed for a monetary sum and picked up by beverage companies. These beverage companies take PET bottles to plants, where caps and labels are discarded, bottles are washed, refilled, and transported back to stores. The Swedish refillable PET bottle can be reused up to 20 times with an average 3.3 refill rate per year (Amano, 2004, p. 40).
 In the United States of America (U.S.), eleven states have implemented their own bottle deposit laws—covering 29 percent of the U.S.  population (Viscusi et al, 2012, p. 197). Evaluating the U.S, non-deposit states for PET plastic have a recycling rate of 20% compared to 48% in deposit states (Container Recycling Institute, 2013, p. 10). Similar to the Swedish system, the U.S. system features consumers who drop off used PET plastic bottles at stores or recycling depots to be redeemed for a monetary sum. However, in the U.S., the recycling of PET plastic is run by independent recycling companies not bottle manufacturers.
These data give us a strong base of insight into the similarities and differences of PET plastic DSRs in the world. Although significant work has been done gathering data in individual case studies, an overarching model addressing what policy components are most effective at creating successful DRS programs currently does not exist. Thus, the objectives of this study include: 1) to collect data on all existing DRSs worldwide, 2) identify the most effective DRS policies, and 3) create an online database for researchers to consult and contribute information about DRSs. This data can provide policymakers with valuable information concerning the international successes and failures of plastic DRS programs such as the United States’ and Sweden’s PET deposit-refund systems. In turn, this knowledge will help aid policymakers in avoiding the creation of ill-informed policies that unnecessarily waste time and capital.
 
Approach
This study aims to identify all existing DRSs around the world and to identify their associated recycling rates. To identify current DRS programs, we gathered statistics and data from the scientific literature. Due to its worldwide scope, this project collected data from numerous sources of scientific literature. We organized the statistical findings of various scientific reports into the following nine variables: region, features, deposit amount, containers covered, PET deposit legislation, PET consumed, PET recollection rate, PET recycling rate, and state agency. Definitions of these nine variables is included below: 
 
●          Region: A physical territory with a national, state or municipal government and a DRS program.
●          Deposit Amount: The amount of money that the consumer pays as a deposit at the point of sale and/or the amount of money that the consumer is refunded at the point of return.
●          Features: Distinctive aspects of a DRS, including legal obligations and roles of the government, consumers, and producers in the flow of the deposit amount. 
●          PET Deposit Legislation: The year(s) a law regulating a DRS was passed or revised.  
●          PET Consumed: The amount of PET plastic bottles that consumers consume within a region.
●          PET Recollection Rate: The proportion of total consumed bottles (i.e. PET Consumed) that are returned to a DRS program within one year. We can also use the formula: PET Plastic Bottles Consumed / PET Plastic Bottles Returned
●          PET Recycling Rate: Calculated differently among the studies, but generally the proportion of plastic bottles reused in the manufacturer of other goods.
●          State Agency: The agency that runs a region’s DRS operations--may be the government, a private company, or a nonprofit.
 
Methods
 
Literature Review
First, we conducted a literature review to search relevant articles, papers and news about existing Deposit-Refund Systems around the world. We use the following search engines: ScienceDirect and Google Scholar with phrases that combine keywords such as PET bottle, deposit-refund system, legislation, recycling rate, and specific country names such as “Canada” or “Mexico.”
 
Creating a Google Sheet & downloading csv
After completing the literature review, we placed all relevant data into a Google Sheet. We organized the Google Sheet in a manner that could be easily turned into code. Each of the nine variables (region, deposit amount, features, etc.) possessed its own column, allowing for each country’s data to be placed into one row. An example of this formatting can be seen below (Figure 1). After completing this Google Sheets, we then download a comma delimited file (csv) of this data to the computer.

A GeoJSON file is a style of code that represents geographic data and it is often used to create maps online.
Adding GeoJSON and CSV to GitHub Repository                                                                                       Finally, we uploaded both the csv and GeoJSON files to GitHub at https://github.com/sophiasiqueiros/deposit-refund-systems for safekeeping and mapmaking. Uploading both the csv and GeoJSON ensures that the methods are transparent to all map visitors. Furthermore, these files can be used by interested parties to create their own maps.
Results
 
Types of DRS Program
In total, the literature review revealed 28 countries with 47 DRSs currently in-place. 24 countries had national DRS programs, while four countries had local DRS programs (Figure 2). We defined a national DRS program as a DRS system set-up and mandated by national laws, and a local DRS program as a system set-up and mandated by regional laws. Of these 28 countries, more than half are in the European continent, followed by North America, Oceania, Asia, and Africa (Figure 3). The 24 countries with national DRS programs included: Austria, Latvia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Micronesia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Kiribati, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, South Africa, South Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Scotland. The four countries with regional DRS programs included: Canada with 10 DRSs controlled by 10 different regional laws, China with 1 DRS controlled by 1 regional law, Mexico with 1 DRS controlled by 1 regional law, and the United States with 11 DRSs controlled by 11 different regional laws (Appendix B).

Population Covered
Collectively, these 47 DRSs cover about 579, 267, 957 people around the world (Appendix B). The 24 countries with national DRSs all covered 100% of their population (Appendix A). The four countries with local DRSs, however, did not cover 100% of their population. From population data, we found that approximately 57% of Canada’s total population is covered by its 10 DRSs, 1% of China’s total population is covered by its 1 DRS, and 28% of the United States’ total population is covered by its 11 DRSs (Figure 4). It is also important to note that the proportion of Mexico’s population covered by its 1 DRS could not be identified in the scientific literature. These statistics highlight that DRSs vary widely in their scope and size; for example, China’s 1 DRS program covered more three times as many people as Canada’s 11 DRS programs combined (Figure 4).

Deposit Amounts
We found information on the deposit-refund amounts for 33 of the 47 DRSs. These countries and regions included: Austria, Belgium, Canada-Alberta, Canada-British Columbia, Canada-New Brunswick, Canada-Newfoundland, Canada-Northwest Territory, Canada-Nova Scotia, Canada-Prince Edward Island, Canada-Quebec, Canada-Yukon, Denmark, the Federated States of Micronesia, Finland, Germany, Kiribati, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, South Australia, Sweden, USA-California, USA-Connecticut, USA-Delaware, USA-Hawaii, USA-Iowa, USA-Maine, USA-Massachusetts, USA-Michigan, USA-New York, USA-Oregon, and USA-Vermont (Appendix B).
         The distribution of deposit-refund amounts vary from less than $0.05 USD to $0.40 USD (Figure 7). We defined deposit-refund amounts as the amount of money that a consumer receives upon returning their PET bottles” The definition of deposit-refund amounts did not consider the amount of money that a consumer pays at the point of exchange. It is important to note that some DRSs, like South Australia or the Federated States of Micronesia, featured two different deposit-refund rates. South Australia’s DRS deposit-refund amount is $0.10 USD if returned to a retailer and $0.05 USD if returned to a collection depot (Appendix B). The Federated States of Micronesia’s DRS deposit-refund amount is $0.05 USD back, although consumers pay $0.06 USD at the point of sale. 
We found that the most common deposit-refund amount was $0.05 USD with 42% or 14/33 of the DRS programs refunding this amount. Furthermore, 6% of the DRSs featured deposit-refund rates of less than $0.05 USD, 24% featured rates of more than $0.05 to $0.10 USD, 21% featured rates of less than $0.10 to $0.15 USD, 6% featured rates of more than $0.15 to $0.20 USD, and 3% featured rates of more than $0.35 to $0.40 USD. In fact, there is only one deposit-return rate of $0.40 USD in Austria (Figure 5).


Figure 5.  Count of deposit-refund amounts for PET bottles <0.5 L in current USD.
 
To investigate if there existed a difference in count when using purchasing power parity (PPP) instead of current exchange rates to convert foreign currency deposit-amounts, we used the World Banks’ Eurostat-OECD PPP Program. It is important to note that we could only use PPP for data that was not already put into US dollars. 26 of the 33 deposit-return rates were reported in US dollars within the scientific literature (Appendix B). Thus, we were able to use PPP on only 7 deposit-refund amounts. Although a small proportion, the difference in using PPP rather than exchange rates makes a significant difference. Almost 85% or 28/33 of the deposit amounts are in the more than $0.05 to $.010 USD range compared to 67% or 22/28 using exchange rates (Figure 5, Figure 6). Furthermore, the proportion of deposit-refund amounts in the range of more than $0.10 to $0.15 USD is reduced to 6% or 2/33 from 21% or 7/33 (Figure 6). This rate nearly equalized with the proportion of deposit-refund amounts with less than $0.05 USD, more than $0.15 to $0.20 USD, and more than $0.35 to $0.40 USD (Figure 6).

PET Recollection & Recycling Rates
Through the literature review, we found PET recollection rates for 25 of the 47 total DRSs (Appendix B).  A recollection rate is defined as the proportion of total consumed bottles that are returned to a DRS program within one year. It is important to note that recollection rates were not reported in uniform measurements. 10 DRSs provided recollection rates for PET bottles alone, 8 DRSs provided recollection rates for all materials accepted within their programs including items such as aluminum cans and glass bottles, 3 DRSs featured separate recollection rates for both PET bottles and overall materials accepted, and 4 DRSs featured miscellaneous rates with measurements such as pounds collected or soft drink recollection rates.
To evaluate as much data as possible, we focused on PET recollection rates and overall recollection rates. Focusing on PET recollection rates, we evaluated 13 DRSs: Mexico, UK-Scotland, USA-California, USA-Iowa, Austria, USA-Oregon, South Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and China-Beijing.  The distribution of these 13 DRS recollection rates varied from about 30% to almost 100% (Figure 7).
Focusing on overall recollection rates, we evaluated 11 DRSs: USA-California, USA-Massachusetts, USA-Connecticut, USA-New York, USA-Hawaii, USA-Maine, USA-Oregon, Canada-Saskatchewan, USA-Iowa, USA-Vermont, and USA-Michigan. The distribution of these 11 DRS recollection rates varied from 61% to 97% (Figure 8). This is a much smaller range of 36 percentage points compared to the range of PET recollection rates of 70 percentage points.

Discussion
                To explore if there existed a correlation between deposit-amounts and recollection rates, we directly compared DRSs for which we had both recollection rates and deposit-refund amounts (Figure 9, Figure 10). Overall, we were able to evaluate 9 DRSs on their PET recollection rates compared to their deposit-amounts (both by exchange rate and PPP value), and 10 DRSs on their overall recollection rates compared to their deposit-amounts (both by exchange rate and PPP value).
It is important to note that when evaluating Figure 9, we see three rows highlighted in yellow. These highlights indicate DRSs which reported their deposit-amounts in foreign currency. For these programs, we manually determined the US exchange rate and PPP rate. If a DRS is not highlighted, this indicates that no manual calculation occurred since the deposit-refund amount was reported in US dollars. Evaluating Figure 10, we see that all 10 DRSs are not highlighted. Because all deposit-refund amounts were reported in US dollars, there was no reason to determine PPP values.
Evaluating Figure 9 and Figure 11, we see that generally as the PET recollection rate increases, so does the PET deposit amount both in exchange rates and PPP values. It is interesting to note, however, that USA-California, USA-Iowa, and USA-Oregon all feature deposit-amounts of $0.05 USD but have PET recollection rates ranging from 46% to 68% (Figure 9). This indicates that the variation in PET recollection rates cannot be solely explained by the variation in deposit-refund amounts. Furthermore, when evaluating Figure 11 we see a R^2 of 0.02. This means that the deposit-refund amount (in exchange rates) explains 2% of the total variation in the PET recollection rates. This low R^2 value seems to indicate there does not exist a correlation between deposit-amount and recollection rate. It is important to note, however, that the regression was performed on a small sample size with a large outlier of $0.40 USD and a 65% PET recollection rate. Most likely, this outlier skewed the data and the subsequent R^2 value.
                Evaluating Figure 10 and Figure 12, we again see a general positive correlation-- except this time between overall recollection rates and PET deposit-refund amounts. It is important to note that 9/10 of the DRSs have a deposit-refund amount of $0.05 USD, yet overall PET recollection rates range from 61% to 97%. This evidence further causes us to suspect that the total variation in recollection rates cannot be explained solely by the variation in deposit-refund amounts. Furthermore, when examining Figure 12 we see a R^2 of .233 or 23.3%. This means that the deposit-refund amounts (by exchange rates) explain 23.3% of the total variation in overall recollection rates. This is a significant difference from Figure 11’s R^2 of 2%. This discrepancy, however, must be taken with a consideration of the small sample size and large outliers of $0.040 USD in Figure 11 and $0.10 USD in Figure 12 which may disproportionately skew the data. To get a reliable R^2, a large sample size would be the optimal situation. As sample size increases, error is reduced.

Insights & Limitations
Although preliminary, this study fills an essential gap in knowledge concerning Deposit-Refund Systems around the world. Before this study, there existed few comprehensive analyses on the types of DRS strategies that are used and their effectiveness. Some studies that have, however, begun to analyze Deposit Refund Systems around the world include CM Consulting Inc. and Reloop Platform’s Deposit Systems for One-Way Beverage Containers: Global Overview (https://www.cmconsultinginc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BOOK-Deposit-Global-24May2017-for-Website.pdf) and the Container Recycling Institute’s Bottle Bill Resource Guide (http://www.bottlebill.org). Given the time constraints of this study there is undoubtedly more information to be found about Deposit-Refund Systems around the world. We hope, however, that this study can serve as a useful starting point for future researchers to start their own studies of Deposit-Refund Systems around the world. A particularly interesting point of research for future researchers is the correlation between recollection rates and deposit-refund amounts. Does a positive correlation truly exist between recollection rates and deposit-refund amounts? Or, is there another explanatory variable such as “institutions” or “government funding” that can better explain variation in recollection rates? It is also important to note that recollection rates and recycling rates in the study are not all from the same year. If interested in further exploring this topic, future researchers should focus on collecting data that is from the same year to better compare between countries and regions. Given the ever-increasing need to turn to a more circular economy, this research question is crucial for improving our rates of recollection and recycling.
 
Conclusion
This research study identified 47 PET Deposit-Return Systems in 28 countries and created an online database to summarize basic features and statistics of these systems. The results of this study created a database which provides a baseline of information for future academics to research and identify crucial policy components of successful PET plastic DRS programs.

	Containers taxed $0.52 per liter unless they have deposit (Hogg et al.,2010); An eco-tax of 0.1 €/l on one-way and reusable beverage packaging is charged. This was intended to be refundable on return, however, the return scheme was not installed. (European Parliament, 2011)

	All containers must be refillable, and none collected can be landfilled or incinerated. Beer separate system, though still under legislation (Hogg et al., 2010)
	89 depots around the providence. Deposits paid on all containers (bar milk), but whilst full paid back on refillables, only half paid back on non-refillables. (Hogg et al., 2010)
	"Green depots" run as businesses. Half-back system, with manufacturers prohibited from selling containers other than recyclable or refillable for selected products.

	Deposit-return system plus environmental handling charge (EHC) for non-refillable containers, for recycling, and beer bottle deposit system for refillables (Hogg et al., 2010)
	No kerbside collection. Deposit-return system, with ‘recycling club’ for children offering ‘prizes’ as well as refund if certain numbers reached. Refillables not charged recycling fund fee, all others are. (Hogg et al., 2010)
	No systematic regulations and laws to standardize the industry and residents on how to recycle and dispose of the PET bottles. Informal system of collectors . Until 2017, the Incom Recycle, a company working on the DRS of recyclable PET bottles, has installed 5000 waste-buying depots in Beijing. (Kou, 2019)
	Deposit-return plus "incentive fee" to be paid by producer if 50% refill isn't met. 5% paid still, if target is met. (Hogg et al.,2010)

Retailers selling non- refillables, must also sell similar products in refillable (Hogg et al., 2010) ; Deposit-refund system on beverage packaging mandatory for one-way containers. The Norwegian system works in such a way that the excise tax decreases as the returns increases, meaning that for example 90 per cent returns for cans translates into a 90 per cent discount on the excise tax. (European Parliament, 2011)
	Deposit-refund system on beverage packaging voluntary for reusable containers (European Parliament, 2011)
	A mandatory deposit for both reusable and one-way beverage packaging. The deposit system up to now works satisfactorily only for glass beer packaging. (European Parliament, 2011)
